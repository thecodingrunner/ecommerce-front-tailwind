<h2>Description:</h2>
A Next.js-powered website showcasing a local artist's work, featuring an integrated e-commerce shop.

<h2>Project Purpose and Goal:</h2>
This project aims to showcase a local artist/photographer's portfolio while providing a seamless e-commerce experience. The website serves dual purposes: it acts as a digital gallery, highlighting the artist's diverse body of work, and functions as an online storefront. Local businesses can easily browse and purchase customized products featuring the artist's imagery, such as greeting cards and mugs. By combining artistic presentation with practical commerce, the site creates a platform that not only promotes the artist's talent but also facilitates direct sales to a targeted local market.

<h2>Webstack and Explanation:</h2>
This e-commerce project leverages Next.js for robust front-end and server-side rendering, coupled with MongoDB for efficient data management. Stripe integration enables secure online transactions, adding a professional payment gateway to the platform. Two significant challenges were overcome during development: first, seamlessly incorporating Stripe's complex payment system, and second, designing an intuitive admin interface that simplifies product management. The resulting admin platform allows for easy addition and modification of shop items, streamlining the backend operations. This combination of technologies and user-friendly design creates a powerful, yet manageable e-commerce solution.
