Gerry Spangles still thought it was a spacecraft. He had glimpsed something not dissimilar in last week's episode of Blake's 7. He wondered if it would land so he could have a go. He called to Jack Nastie, “Look at that, high in the night sky, I think it's a spacecraft”. “It's a f**king plane Gerry” said Jack Nastie, in that withering tone people use when they think you're a bit of a daft b*****d.`,
